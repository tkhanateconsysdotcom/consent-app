```

<br />

### 👩🏾‍💻 Development

- Eslint is used in the project to enforce code style and should be configured in your [editor](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations).

- Prettier is also used and apply automatically by eslint

- Typescript is used in the project for type-checking and should be configured in your [editor](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Editor-Support).

You can check this manually by running:

```bash
$ yarn lint
```

or

```bash
$ yarn typescript
```

You can ask eslint to fix issues by running:

```bash
$ yarn lint:fix
```

<br />

<br />

### 🎨 Storybook

```bash
$ yarn prestorybook
```

<br />

### 📗 Sustainable guide

To place new `.md` files inside `guides` folder or modify existing guide and then run `node scripts/generate-guides.js` to generate a new sustainable guide. Images can be used in the `.md` as follow: `![Earth](earth.png)` and should be place in `assets/images/guide`.

<br />

Same for methodology screen, just run `node scripts/generate-methodology.js` to update `methodology.json` from `methodology.md`.

<br />

## 🗣 Translations

You can help us with translate the app with our online tool [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/join/project/0MbginCsWp).

So far the app supports English, French, German, Swedish, Danish, Russian, Portugal, Polish.

<br />

### Generate

Run `node scripts/generate-translation-files.js` in order to create the files needed for the new language you want to add to the app.

### Manage Files

Run `node scripts/poeditor/group-translation-files.js` to generate 1 JSON file per language, with all the translation vars in it. From there, you can easily make any edit you want. When you're done, you can run `node scripts/poeditor/spread-translation-files.js` to merge your edits and spread them into all the translation files across the repo.

<br />

### 🚀 Deployment

Any tag starting with `v` will runs expo publish. During this step `app.example.json` is used to generate an `app.json` file for expo's deployment, this is done with the following script `scripts/generate-app-json.js`.

<br />
